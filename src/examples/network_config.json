    "Description" : "This file must consists information about network configuration. Network is a multilayer perceptron with usual structure: each unit has connection with each unit in previous layer. Therefore structure of network can be defined by number of input units and 1d-array of data with information about number of units in each layer and type of activation function. Activation function may have next values - linear, sigmoid or tanh",
